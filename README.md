# Happy Thoughts

This project aims to practice and understand useEffect hook and increase my skills with the useState hook,
fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

The project was approached as following:
-Inspecting and understanding the respons and info from the API.
-Trying to break down the wished result into small fragments.
-Creating components for every fragment and keeping it simple to follow the code.
-Styling the components as close as possible to the provided design sketch

If I had more time I would have tried to:
-Implement a local storage counter that keeps track of the amount of likes you clicked.
-Implement a loader when the pages loads.
-Implement an animation every time a new message is shown. Some kind of "entering" effect.
